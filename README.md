The website is used to showcase and display my side projects as well as provide privacy policies and other documents for the projects I create.

Here is the website: http://daniyalmoha.me/

I programmed this static website completely through HTML and CSS. Spent around 4-5 days of around 2 hours each. Learned how to utilize VS Code, Github Pages, Git, Jekyll and Brew to create a static website. Learned design fundamentals and how to link pictures and make them dynamic. I also programmed a blog format generator that allows me to easily add new blog/project posts on the website.
