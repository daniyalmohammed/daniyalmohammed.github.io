My first website programmed completely through HTML and CSS; took about 4-5 days of around 2 hours each. Learned how to utilize VS, Github Pages, Git, Jekyll and Brew to create a static website. Learned design fundamentals and how to link pictures and make them dynamic.

Used to showcase and display my side projects as well as provide privacy policies and other documents for the projects I create.
