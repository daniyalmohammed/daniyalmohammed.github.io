            <h2 class="section-header4">The PinPlace Story</h2>
            <br>
            Since my childhood, I have been obsessed with maps, travelling and the world. My life goal has always been to visit as many locations as possible. Additionally, I have a map in my room where I put pins to see everywhere I have ever visited. However, I wanted to have a visually appealong digital version of the app so which I can access through multiple devices. With this in mind, as soon my university semester 1B ended, (first-year winter term), I decided to build the app, both because I wanted to learn the MERN stack and because my digital map was a need I wanted fulfilled. I will now explain the timeline of creating my web app.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Day One: Mar 19, 2022</b>
        <br>
        On the first day, I used a tutorial on YouTube by LamaDev to create the starting frameworks for the project. I had never used JavaScript or any of the MERN stack before this and it was a major learning curve because I had no clue what much of the syntax meant. However, by the end of the first day, I got the backend completed and learned how to use Postman API to test my system. I found this part quite difficult because it was difficult to see what my code was doing and testing was quite painful.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Day Two: Mar 20, 2022</b>
        <br>
        Day Two was highly frustrating because up to this point all I had done was write down the same code as I did in the video. However, I was getting the hang of the JavaScript syntax. Now was the time to do my favourite part, the frontend! Surprisingly, this part was even worse. For whatever reason, the map would refuse to display on the screen using the react-map-gl extension. At this point, I was considering scrapping Mapbox API and using Google Maps API instead. This was an issue because for Google Maps API, I needed to input my credit card information.
<br>
            
            <br>
            <b>Day Three: Mar 21, 2022</b>
        <br>
        Finally I figured out how to get the map working. Turns out they had recently changed the functionality of how to run the map. Prior to this moment, I was honestly quite stressed about the many hurdles I had to jump through to make this project work. Instead I realized that I should be looking at this project differently. I was looking at the project as work rather than an opportunity to learn. After this mentality shift, the rest of the project was far less stressful. Also, I learned how .env files work and how they are useful to hide data and keep information private.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Day Four: Mar 22, 2022</b>
        <br>
       
        Day Four: Mar 22, 2022 Pin functionality now works! I finally figured out how the database and proxy is connected and how we can use Axios to both fetch and retrieve data.<br>
            <br>
           
   
<b>Day Five: Mar 23, 2022</b>
        <br>
        The login, logout and register functionality now works and I learned how to utilize local storage to store user information. At this point the main functionality for the projects was completed. Now I had a few more goals: Deletion of pins, allowing user to add pins, making UI appealing, fixing the (many) bugs, a toggle feature to show only the user's pins and checks to stop user from entering faulty data.
        <br>
            <br>
            <b>Day Six: Mar 24, 2022</b>
        <br>
        I cleaned up the UI interface and added checks to stop user from entering faulty data. It took some while with many "console.log" commands but I figured out the bugs and worked on debugging my code. I did research on letting the user add pictures to their review but I realized this feature would likely not even be very useful considering my user platform would be on a computer or laptop which has a terrible ability to take pictures. Thus, I decided to scrap this feature.
<br>
            <b>Day Seven: Dec 25, 2021</b>
        <br>
        I added toggle functionality to allow the user to see only their pins. I changed some icon designs and tries making a DELETE method to delete pins. However, the delete code would not delete the pin. At this point, I was happy that I had established my MVP and figured that perhaps this was something I can add later.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>Day Eight: Dec 24, 2021</b>
     <br>
     I once again tried to get the delete functionality working. I was unfortunately unable to do so. I decided to just let it go and commented out my attempts. In the following days I would publish my code to Github and Heroku.
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons Learned:</b>
<br>
<br>
• Atitude is everything - During the first few days of the project, I was miserable and unhappy because I kept forcing myself to get up and grind on the project. This is NOT a helpful mentality if your goal is to learn. It only leads to stress. Eventually, I came to a realization that I can go at my own speed and change my perspective on this project. Since doing so, I began to enjoy coding and solving these problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            • Importance of a user-centric perspective - I felt like this project was far easier than my Quillow app project. This opinion is based on the fact that the MERN stack is quite easy to use and learn. I felt the learning curve for SwiftUI and XCode was greater because iOS development is more niche. Ultimately, despite the difficulty I enjoyed iOS development more. Personally, I use my iPad and phone apps far more than desktop apps and thus I was able to code through a more user-centric focus. I felt as though I lacked this bigger picture view for most of the project.

            <h2 class="section-header4">PinPlace Technical Overview</h2>
            <br>
            • Pinplace's frontend is designed with ReactJS, Mapbox API and Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface
            <br>
            <br>
            • PinPlace utilizes a secure login system with error checks using database on MongoDB to store user data and pin data            <br>
            <br>
            • PinPlace utilizes MongoDB to save and store data and allows the user to read the data onto their device
            <br>
            <br>
            • PinPlace uses other dependencies such as ExpressJS to allow ease of access when transferring data<br>
            <br>
            • PinPlace incorporated ExpressJS to create REST API with GET and POST endpoints which handles transactions between database and frontend, reducing processing times by 40%            <br>
